    <p class="frontpageDesc">With about 110.994 kmÂ² of area, Bulgaria is a country that's too small to be the biggest, but stil not big enough to be called a "giant".<br> Established way back in 681 AC, survived trough several major National disasters, Bulgaria still thrives
        even today.
    </p>

    <p class="frontpageDesc">
        With the main part of Bulgarian economics being Tourism, both sea and mountain, the country is well-recognised all around the globe.<br> Rich history and artifacts attract many people, some of who remain to live in this heavenly place that is
        often called "God's sacred place".
