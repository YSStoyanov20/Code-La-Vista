            <h1>An Extended map of Bulgaria</h1>
            <h2>Where you learn what you dont</h2>

            <p>With about 110.994 kmÂ² of area, Bulgaria is a country that's too small to be the biggest, but stil not big enough to be called a "giant". Established way back in 681 AC, survived trough several major National disasters, Bulgaria still thrives
                even today.</p>
            <p>With the main part of Bulgarian economics being Tourism, both sea and mountain, the country is well-recognised all around the globe. Rich history and artifacts attract many people, some of who remain to live in this heavenly place that is
                often called "God's sacred place".</p>
